You never loved me. \nYou never loved to begin with. You never loved me. \n\nDon't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more, than everybody, anybody else. \nSeventeen and bad, was the best you never had and you won't, sins you never said for yourself. \nSeven, six, five, four, three, two, one everybody got a name, everybody got a number. \nSeven sins in six frames, five for the two of us, three is too much when there's only one love. \n\nHere he come, let him know, leave him hung, let him go up to dry, you're up to dry. \nLight it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow, up and dry, you're up and dry \n\nFor the six months you gave, the seventh month you keep \nYou stay, for six days and the seventh day you'll leave \nAnd every day you're here, I count until you're gone. \nSeven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\n\nAll Rights Reserved RKS 2013",

Meath's powerful voice is front and center, unjoined by fellow harmonizers as it is in her folk group, Mountain Man. Sanborn, who plays bass in the genre-destroying Megafaun, creates intricate, pulsing grooves for Meath's voice to inhabit. The pair's debut is the Hey Mami / Play It Right 12″, a \"single\" with 2 A sides, featuring acapella and instrumental versions of each song. The record will be released July 16, 2013.",
